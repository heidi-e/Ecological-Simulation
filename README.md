## Fox vs. Rabbit: A Multi-Species Ecological Simulation

This is a simulation project that models the interactions between two species, Cotton Tail Rabbit (Sylvilagus floridanus) and the Common Red Fox (Vulpes vulpes), in a virtual ecosystem. The simulation allows us to observe and understand the dynamics of inter-species competition and co-existence.

## Installation
To run the simulation, you will need Python 3 and the following libraries:
```
NumPy
Random
Matplotlib.pyplot as plt
Matplotlib.animation as animation
Numpy as np
Copy
From collections import defaultdict
Matplotlib.colors as colors
Argparse
```
## Usage
To start the simulation, simply run the final_ecological_simulation.py file:

The simulation window will appear, showing the rabbits and foxes moving around in the virtual ecosystem. The rabbits will graze on the grass and give birth to offspring when they find enough food. The foxes will hunt and feed on the rabbits, and reproduce less frequently than the rabbits. Both species will need to find food to survive and avoid starvation.

The simulation will continue until you close the window or press the "ESC" key.
